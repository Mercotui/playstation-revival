# playstation-revival

After many years of reliable entertainment, my PlayStations have burned out their disk readers.
I'm trying to revive them without modifying the hardware.

I have:

- Sony Playstation 1 SCPH-9002
- Sony Playstation 2 SCPH-77004

Both of them have PAL video out, and both of them have burned out CD drives.

To start I flash a bootloader onto a memory card, [see steps](memory-card/README.md).
